Save your Jupyter notebook, exporting it into a Python file. It's like preserving your musical composition in sheet music for others to play.

### `Run Flask Server! 🚀`

Fire up the Flask server from your Python file. The server is like a conductor, orchestrating the interaction between your machine learning model and the HTML front-end.

### `Open app.html in Your Browser! 🌐`

Point your browser to the local HTML file, just like enjoying a private concert. Your SportsPersonClassifier is ready to showcase its predictions.(in my case i can open by [file:///C:/Users/PRANEETH/Desktop/SportPersonClassifier/UI/app.html](this))
